# My vim config file

Don't forget to install [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) first for things to work. To do that
```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

Put the `vimrc` file in your home directory
```
cp vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

Launch vim and install the plugins (make sure you have selected which ones you want to enable/disable).
```
:PluginInstall
```

**Note that I have turned off the arrow keys in vim, so procede with caution or re-enable them**.
